--------Web Application Reconnaissance---------------------------
> Use tools such as Netcraft (https://www.netcraft.com), SmartWhois (https://www.tamos.com), WHOIS Lookup (http://whois.domaintools.com), 
and Batch IP Converter (http://www.sabsoft.com) to perform the Whois lookup.
>Use tools such as Professional Toolset (https://tools.dnsstuff.com), DNSRecon (https://github.com), and DNS Records (https://network-tools.com),
Domain Dossier (https://centralops.net) to perform DNS interrogation.

>Now, we will perform port scanning to gather information about the open ports and
services running on the machine hosting the target website.
~~~Parrot Machine
>Parrot Terminal window appears. In the terminal window, type sudo su and press Enter
>Now, type cd and press Enter to jump to the root directory.
>In the Parrot Terminal window, type nmap -T4 -A -v [Target Web Application] 
(here, the target web application is www.<site>.com) and press Enter to perform a port and service discovery scan.
In this command, -T4: specifies setting time template (0-5), -A: specifies aggressive scan, 
and -v: enables the verbose output (include all hosts and ports in the output).
The result appears, displaying the open ports and services running on the machine hosting the target website.

>Now, perform banner grabbing to identify the make, model, and version of the target web server software.
>In the terminal window, type telnet www.<site>.com 80 and press Enter to establish a telnet connection with the target machine.
Port 80 is the port number assigned to the commonly used Internet communication protocol, Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
>The Trying a.b.c.d… message appears; type GET / HTTP/1.0 and press Enter two times.
>The result appears, displaying information related to the server name and its version, technology used.
Here, the server is identified as Microsoft-IIS/10.0 and the technology used is ASP.NET.

------------------------------Perform Web Application Reconnaissance using WhatWeb------------------
WhatWeb identifies websites and recognizes web technologies, including content management systems (CMS), 
blogging platforms, statistics and analytics packages, JavaScript libraries, web servers, and embedded devices. 
It also identifies version numbers, email addresses, account IDs, web framework modules, SQL errors, and more.
Here, we will perform web application reconnaissance using the WhatWeb tool.

>Parrot Terminal window appears. In the terminal window, type sudo su and press Enter
>Now, type cd and press Enter to jump to the root directory.
>In the Terminal window, type whatweb and press Enter. It displays a list of the commands available with WhatWeb.
>Now, type whatweb [Target Web Application] (here, the target web application is www.<site>.com) 
and press Enter to perform website footprinting on the target website.
The result appears, displaying the MovieScope website infrastructure, as shown in the screenshot.
>In the terminal, type whatweb -v [Target Web Application] press Enter to run a verbosity scan on the target website.
The result appears, displaying a detailed report on the target website such as its 
IP address, plugin information, and HTTP header information, as shown in the screenshot.
>Now, type whatweb --log-verbose=MovieScope_Report www.moviescope.com and press Enter to export the 
results returned by WhatWeb as a text file.This will generate a report with the name MovieScope_Report
and save this file in the root folder.

------------------------------Detect Load Balancers (dig and lbd)--------------------
A Parrot Terminal window appears
>type dig yahoo.com and press Enter.
The result appears, displaying the available load balancers of the target website, 
as the screenshot demonstrates. Here, a single host resolves to multiple IP addresses, 
which possibly indicates that the host is using a load balancer. dig command provides detailed results 
and is used to identify whether the target domain is resolving to multiple IP addresses.

>Now, type lbd yahoo.com and press Enter.
The result appears, displaying the available DNS load balancers used by the target website, as shown in the screenshot.
lbd (load balancing detector) detects if a given domain uses DNS and http load balancing via the Server:
and Date: headers and the differences between server answers. 
It analyzes the data received from application responses to detect load balancers.

---------------------------------------Identify Web Server Directories----------------------
Web servers host the web applications, so misconfigurations while hosting these web applications may 
lead to the exposure of critical files and directories over the Internet. A professional ethical hacker 
or pen tester must identify the target web application’s files and directories exposed on the Internet 
using various automated tools such as Nmap and Gobuster. This information further helps to gather sensitive
information stored in the files and folders.

Here, we will use Nmap and Gobuster tool to identify web server directories on the target website.
>A Parrot Terminal window appears; type nmap -sV --script=http-enum [target domain or IP address] 
(here, the target website is www.<site>.com) and press Enter.
The result appears, displaying open ports and services, along with their version.
Scroll-down in the result and observe the identified web server directories under the http-enum section
>Now, we shall copy the wordlist file (common.txt) from a shared network drive. We will use this file in the Gobuster tool.
Minimize the Terminal window.
>Click Places from the top-section of the Desktop and click Desktop from the drop-down options.
>Navigate to CEHv11 Module 14 Hacking Web Applications folder and copy common.txt file.
Press Ctrl+C to copy the folder.
Paste the copied file (common.txt) on the Desktop. Close the window.
Press Ctrl+V to paste the folder.
>Now, switch back to the terminal window, type gobuster dir -u [Target Website] -w /home/attacker/Desktop/common.txt, and press Enter.
(dir: uses directory or file brute-forcing mode, -u: specifies the target URL (here, www.moviescope.com), 
and -w: is the wordlist file used for directory brute-forcing (here, common.txt).
>The result appears, displaying the identified web server directories

--------------------Perform Web Application Vulnerability Scanning using Vega (Windows)----------------
Vega is a web application scanner used to test the security of web applications. 
It helps you to find and validate SQL Injection, XSS, inadvertently disclosed sensitive information, and other vulnerabilities.
