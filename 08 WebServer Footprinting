Ghost Eye is an information-gathering tool written in Python 3. To run, Ghost Eye only needs a domain or IP. 
Ghost Eye can work with any Linux distros if they support Python 3.
Ghost Eye gathers information such as Whois lookup, DNS lookup, EtherApe, Nmap port scan, HTTP header grabber, Clickjacking test, 
Robots.txt scanner, Link grabber, IP location finder, and traceroute.
