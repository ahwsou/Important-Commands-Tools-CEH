-------------------------Detect SQL Injection Vulnerabilities using DSSS----------------
Parrot Terminal window appears. 
>In the terminal window, type sudo su and press Enter to run the programs as a root user.
>Now, type cd and press Enter to jump to the root directory.
>In the MATE Terminal type cd DSSS and press Enter to navigate to the DSSS folder which is alredy downloaded.
>In the terminal window, type python3 dsss.py and press Enter to view a list of available options in the DSSS application
>Now, minimize the Terminal window and click on the Firefox icon in the top section of Desktop to launch Firefox.
>In the Mozilla Firefox window, type http://www.<site>.com/ in the address bar and press Enter. 
A Login page loads; enter the Username and Password as sam and test, respectively. Click the Login button.
>Once you are logged into the website, click the View Profile tab from the menu bar; 
and when the page has loaded, make a note of the URL in the address bar of the browser.

>Right-click anywhere on the webpage and click Inspect Element (Q) from the context menu
>The Developer Tools frame appears in the lower section of the browser window. 
Click the Console tab, type document.cookie in the lower-left corner of the browser, and press Enter.
>Select the cookie value, then right-click and copy it, . Minimize the web browser.

>Switch to a terminal window and type python3 dsss.py -u "http://www.<site>.com/viewprofile.aspx?id=1" --cookie="[cookie value which you have copied]" 
and press Enter.
In this command, -u specifies the target URL and --cookie specifies the HTTP cookie header value.
The above command causes DSSS to scan the target website for SQL injection vulnerabilities.
The result appears, showing that the target website (www.<site>.com) is vulnerable to blind SQL injection attacks. 
The vulnerable link is also displayed, as shown in the screenshot.

>Highlight the vulnerable website link from the parrot terminal, right-click it, and, from the options, click Copy.
>Switch to Mozilla Firefox; in a new tab, paste the copied link in the address bar and press Enter.
>You will observe that information regarding all the available user accounts appears under the View Profile tab.
Scroll down to view the user account information for all users.
