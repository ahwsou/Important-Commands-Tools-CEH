Overview of Active Sniffing
---------------------------
Active sniffing involves sending out multiple network probes to identify access points. The following is the list of different active sniffing techniques:

>>MAC Flooding: Involves flooding the SWITCH CAM table with fake MAC address and IP pairs until it is full.
When the MAC table fills up, the switch converts to a hub-like operation where an attacker can monitor the data being broadcast. Perform MAC flooding using macof.

>>DNS Poisoning: Involves tricking a DNS server into believing that it has received authentic information when, in reality, it has not.

>>ARP Poisoning: Involves constructing a large number of forged ARP request and reply packets to overload a switch.
ARP spoofing is a method of attacking an Ethernet LAN. ARP spoofing succeeds by changing the IP address of the attacker’s computer to the IP address of the 
target computer. A forged ARP request and reply packet find a place in the target ARP cache in this process. As the ARP reply has been forged, the destination
computer (target) sends the frames to the attacker’s computer, where the attacker can modify them before sending them to the source machine (User A) in an 
MITM attack.arpspoof redirects packets from a target host (or all hosts) on the LAN intended for another host on the LAN by forging ARP replies. 
This is an extremely effective way of sniffing traffic on a switch.Perform ARP poisoning using arpspoof.

>>DHCP Attacks: Involves performing a DHCP starvation attack and a rogue DHCP server attack.
In a DHCP starvation attack, an attacker floods the DHCP server by sending a large number of DHCP requests and uses all available IP addresses that the DHCP server
can issue. As a result, the server cannot issue any more IP addresses, leading to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack.Because of this issue, valid users cannot obtain
or renew their IP addresses, and thus fail to access their network.Perform a DHCP starvation attack using Yersinia.

>>Spoofing Attack: Involves performing MAC spoofing, VLAN hopping, and STP attacks to steal sensitive information.Spoof a MAC address using TMAC and SMAC.

>>Perform an Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack using Cain & Abel

-------------------------Perform MAC flooding using macof---------------------------------
> In Parrot System Open Wireshark.

The Parrot Terminal window 
> sudo su
> macof -i eth0 -n 10 and press Enter. (-i: specifies the interface and -n: specifies the number of packets to be sent (here, 10).

You can also target a single system by issuing the command:
> macof -i eth0 -d [Target IP Address] (-d: Specifies the destination IP address).

> In Wireshark Click on any captured IPv4 packet and expand the Ethernet II node in the packet details section. 
Information regarding the source and destination MAC addresses is displayed
------------------------------END--------------------------------------


--------------------------Perform a DHCP starvation attack using Yersinia--------------------------
> In Parrot System Open Wireshark.

The Parrot Terminal window : 
> sudo su
> yersinia -I (open Yersinia in interactive mode.)

To remove the Notification window, press any key, and then press h for help.
The Available commands option appears, as shown in the screenshot.
Press q to exit the help options.
Press F2 to select DHCP mode. In DHCP mode, STP Fields in the lower section of the window change to DHCP Fields, as shown in the screenshot.
Press x to list available attack options.
The Attack Panel window appears; press 1 to start a DHCP starvation attack.
After a few seconds, press q to stop the attack and terminate Yersinia, as shown in the screenshot.

> In wireshark, Click on any DHCP packet and expand the Ethernet II node in the packet details section. 
Information regarding the source and destination MAC addresses is displayed,

----------------------------------------------Perform ARP poisoning using arpspoof-------------------------------------------------
> In Parrot System Open Wireshark.

The Parrot Terminal window : 
> sudo su
> arpspoof -i eth0 -t 10.10.10.A 10.10.10.B and press Enter.

(Here, 10.10.10.B is IP address of the target system [Windows 10], and 10.10.10.A is IP address of the access point or gateway)

-i: specifies network interface and -t: specifies target IP address.

Issuing the above command informs the access point that the target system (10.10.10.B) has our MAC address (the MAC address of host machine (Parrot Security)). 
In other words, we are informing the access point that we are the target system.

After sending a few packets, press CTRL + z to stop sending the ARP packets.

> Switch to the Wireshark window and you can observe the captured ARP packets

> Switch back to the terminal window where arpspoof was running. 
> arpspoof -i eth0 -t 10.10.10.B 10.10.10.A and press Enter.

Through the above command, the host system informs the target system (10.10.10.B) that it is the access point (10.10.10.A).

After sending a few packets, press CTRL + z to stop sending the ARP packets.

> In Wireshark, you can observe the ARP packets with an alert warning “duplicate use of 10.10.10.10 detected!”

Click on any ARP packet and expand the Ethernet II node in the packet details section. As shown in the screenshot, you can observe the MAC addresses of IP 
addresses 10.10.10.A and 10.10.10.B. Here, the MAC address of the host system (Parrot Security) is XXXXXXX.
Using arpspoof, we assigned the MAC address of the host system to the target system (Windows 10) and access point. 
Therefore, the alert warning of a duplicate use of 10.10.10.B is displayed.

> You can navigate to the Windows 10 machine and see the IP addresses and their corresponding MAC addresses. 
You will observe that the MAC addresses of IP addresses 10.10.10.A and 10.10.10.C are the same, indicating the occurrence of an ARP poisoning attack, 
where 10.10.10.C is the Parrot Security machine and 10.10.10.A is the access point.

-----------------------------------------------Perform MITM in a switch-based network with Cain & Abel -------------------------
>> Use Cain & Abel to perform ARP poisioning and conduct MITM attack
>> Use Wireshark to detect the attack

~~Cain & Abel
> Click on Cain icon on Windows x.y.z.a
> Click Configure from the menu bar to configure an ethernet card.
> The Configuration Dialog window appears. By default, the Sniffer tab is selected. Ensure that the Adapter associated with the IP address of the machine is selected; 
then, click OK.
> Click the Start/Stop Sniffer icon on the toolbar to begin sniffing.
> A Cain pop-up appears and displays a Warning message; click OK.
> Now, click the Sniffer tab.
> Click the plus (+) icon or right-click in the window and select Scan MAC Addresses to scan the network for hosts.
The MAC Address Scanner window appears. Check the All hosts in my subnet radio button and select the All Tests checkbox; then, click OK.
Cain & Abel starts scanning for MAC addresses and lists all those found.
After completing the scan, a list of all active IP addresses along with their corresponding MAC addresses is displayed
> Now, click the APR tab at the bottom of the window.APR options appear in the left-hand pane. Click anywhere on the topmost section
in the right-hand pane to activate the plus (+) icon.Click the plus (+) icon, a New ARP Poison Routing window appears, from which we can add IPs to listen to traffic.
> To monitor the traffic between two systems  click to select a.b.c.d from the left-hand pane and e.f.g.h from the right-hand pane; click OK.
> Click on the Start/Stop APR icon to start capturing ARP packets.

~~Switch to a.b.c.d
> The Command Prompt window appears; type ftp e.f.g.h and press Enter.
> When prompted for a User, type “Jason” and press Enter; for a Password, type “qwerty” and press Enter.

~~Switch to Windows x.y.z.a where Cain is running
> Irrespective of a successful login, Cain & Abel captures the password entered during login.
> Click the Passwords tab from the bottom of the Cain window. Click FTP from the left-hand pane to view the sniffed password for ftp e.f.g.h,
