Overview of Active Sniffing
---------------------------
Active sniffing involves sending out multiple network probes to identify access points. The following is the list of different active sniffing techniques:

>>MAC Flooding: Involves flooding the SWITCH CAM table with fake MAC address and IP pairs until it is full.
When the MAC table fills up, the switch converts to a hub-like operation where an attacker can monitor the data being broadcast. Perform MAC flooding using macof.

>>DNS Poisoning: Involves tricking a DNS server into believing that it has received authentic information when, in reality, it has not.

>>ARP Poisoning: Involves constructing a large number of forged ARP request and reply packets to overload a switch.Perform ARP poisoning using arpspoof

>>DHCP Attacks: Involves performing a DHCP starvation attack and a rogue DHCP server attack.
In a DHCP starvation attack, an attacker floods the DHCP server by sending a large number of DHCP requests and uses all available IP addresses that the DHCP server
can issue. As a result, the server cannot issue any more IP addresses, leading to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack.Because of this issue, valid users cannot obtain
or renew their IP addresses, and thus fail to access their network.Perform a DHCP starvation attack using Yersinia.

>>Spoofing Attack: Involves performing MAC spoofing, VLAN hopping, and STP attacks to steal sensitive information.Spoof a MAC address using TMAC and SMAC.

>>Perform an Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack using Cain & Abel

-------------------------Perform MAC flooding using macof---------------------------------
> In Parrot System Open Wireshark.

The Parrot Terminal window 
> sudo su
> macof -i eth0 -n 10 and press Enter. (-i: specifies the interface and -n: specifies the number of packets to be sent (here, 10).

You can also target a single system by issuing the command:
> macof -i eth0 -d [Target IP Address] (-d: Specifies the destination IP address).

> In Wireshark Click on any captured IPv4 packet and expand the Ethernet II node in the packet details section. 
Information regarding the source and destination MAC addresses is displayed

--------------------------Perform a DHCP starvation attack using Yersinia--------------------------
> In Parrot System Open Wireshark.

The Parrot Terminal window : 
> sudo su
> yersinia -I (open Yersinia in interactive mode.)

To remove the Notification window, press any key, and then press h for help.
The Available commands option appears, as shown in the screenshot.
Press q to exit the help options.
Press F2 to select DHCP mode. In DHCP mode, STP Fields in the lower section of the window change to DHCP Fields, as shown in the screenshot.
Press x to list available attack options.
The Attack Panel window appears; press 1 to start a DHCP starvation attack.
After a few seconds, press q to stop the attack and terminate Yersinia, as shown in the screenshot.

> In wireshark, Click on any DHCP packet and expand the Ethernet II node in the packet details section. 
Information regarding the source and destination MAC addresses is displayed,
