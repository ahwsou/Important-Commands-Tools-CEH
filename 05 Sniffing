Overview of Active Sniffing
---------------------------
Active sniffing involves sending out multiple network probes to identify access points. The following is the list of different active sniffing techniques:

>>MAC Flooding: Involves flooding the SWITCH CAM table with fake MAC address and IP pairs until it is full.
When the MAC table fills up, the switch converts to a hub-like operation where an attacker can monitor the data being broadcast. Perform MAC flooding using macof.

>>DNS Poisoning: Involves tricking a DNS server into believing that it has received authentic information when, in reality, it has not.

>>ARP Poisoning: Involves constructing a large number of forged ARP request and reply packets to overload a switch.
ARP spoofing is a method of attacking an Ethernet LAN. ARP spoofing succeeds by changing the IP address of the attacker’s computer to the IP address of the 
target computer. A forged ARP request and reply packet find a place in the target ARP cache in this process. As the ARP reply has been forged, the destination
computer (target) sends the frames to the attacker’s computer, where the attacker can modify them before sending them to the source machine (User A) in an 
MITM attack.arpspoof redirects packets from a target host (or all hosts) on the LAN intended for another host on the LAN by forging ARP replies. 
This is an extremely effective way of sniffing traffic on a switch.Perform ARP poisoning using arpspoof

>>DHCP Attacks: Involves performing a DHCP starvation attack and a rogue DHCP server attack.
In a DHCP starvation attack, an attacker floods the DHCP server by sending a large number of DHCP requests and uses all available IP addresses that the DHCP server
can issue. As a result, the server cannot issue any more IP addresses, leading to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack.Because of this issue, valid users cannot obtain
or renew their IP addresses, and thus fail to access their network.Perform a DHCP starvation attack using Yersinia.

>>Spoofing Attack: Involves performing MAC spoofing, VLAN hopping, and STP attacks to steal sensitive information.Spoof a MAC address using TMAC and SMAC.

>>Perform an Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack using Cain & Abel

-------------------------Perform MAC flooding using macof---------------------------------
> In Parrot System Open Wireshark.

The Parrot Terminal window 
> sudo su
> macof -i eth0 -n 10 and press Enter. (-i: specifies the interface and -n: specifies the number of packets to be sent (here, 10).

You can also target a single system by issuing the command:
> macof -i eth0 -d [Target IP Address] (-d: Specifies the destination IP address).

> In Wireshark Click on any captured IPv4 packet and expand the Ethernet II node in the packet details section. 
Information regarding the source and destination MAC addresses is displayed
------------------------------END--------------------------------------


--------------------------Perform a DHCP starvation attack using Yersinia--------------------------
> In Parrot System Open Wireshark.

The Parrot Terminal window : 
> sudo su
> yersinia -I (open Yersinia in interactive mode.)

To remove the Notification window, press any key, and then press h for help.
The Available commands option appears, as shown in the screenshot.
Press q to exit the help options.
Press F2 to select DHCP mode. In DHCP mode, STP Fields in the lower section of the window change to DHCP Fields, as shown in the screenshot.
Press x to list available attack options.
The Attack Panel window appears; press 1 to start a DHCP starvation attack.
After a few seconds, press q to stop the attack and terminate Yersinia, as shown in the screenshot.

> In wireshark, Click on any DHCP packet and expand the Ethernet II node in the packet details section. 
Information regarding the source and destination MAC addresses is displayed,

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
> In Parrot System Open Wireshark.

The Parrot Terminal window : 
> sudo su
> arpspoof -i eth0 -t 10.10.10.A 10.10.10.B and press Enter.

(Here, 10.10.10.B is IP address of the target system [Windows 10], and 10.10.10.A is IP address of the access point or gateway)

-i: specifies network interface and -t: specifies target IP address.

Issuing the above command informs the access point that the target system (10.10.10.B) has our MAC address (the MAC address of host machine (Parrot Security)). 
In other words, we are informing the access point that we are the target system.

After sending a few packets, press CTRL + z to stop sending the ARP packets.


> Switch back to the terminal window where arpspoof was running. 
> arpspoof -i eth0 -t 10.10.10.B 10.10.10.A and press Enter.

Through the above command, the host system informs the target system (10.10.10.B) that it is the access point (10.10.10.A).

After sending a few packets, press CTRL + z to stop sending the ARP packets.

Switch back to the terminal window where arpspoof was running. Type arpspoof -i eth0 -t 10.10.10.10 10.10.10.1 and press Enter.

Through the above command, the host system informs the target system (10.10.10.10) that it is the access point (10.10.10.1).

After sending a few packets, press CTRL + z to stop sending the ARP packets.
