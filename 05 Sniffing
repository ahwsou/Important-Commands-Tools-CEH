Overview of Active Sniffing
---------------------------
Active sniffing involves sending out multiple network probes to identify access points. The following is the list of different active sniffing techniques:

>>MAC Flooding: Involves flooding the CAM table with fake MAC address and IP pairs until it is full. Perform MAC flooding using macof.

>>DNS Poisoning: Involves tricking a DNS server into believing that it has received authentic information when, in reality, it has not.

>>ARP Poisoning: Involves constructing a large number of forged ARP request and reply packets to overload a switch.Perform ARP poisoning using arpspoof

>>DHCP Attacks: Involves performing a DHCP starvation attack and a rogue DHCP server attack.Perform a DHCP starvation attack using Yersinia.

>>Spoofing Attack: Involves performing MAC spoofing, VLAN hopping, and STP attacks to steal sensitive information.Spoof a MAC address using TMAC and SMAC.

>>Perform an Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack using Cain & Abel
