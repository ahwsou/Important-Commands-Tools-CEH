-------------------------------------Web Server Information using Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) (Parrot)------------------
Nmap, along with Nmap Scripting Engine, can extract a lot of valuable information from the target web server. 
In addition to Nmap commands, Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)provides scripts that reveal various useful information 
about the target web server.

>Parrot Terminal window appears. In the terminal window, type sudo su and press Enter
>type cd and press Enter to jump to the root directory.
>Enumerate the directories used by web servers and web applications, in the terminal window.
>Type nmap -sV --script=http-enum [target website] and press Enter.
>In this scan, we are enumerating the www.<site>.com website.

>The next step is to discover the hostnames that resolve the targeted domain.
>In the terminal window, type nmap --script hostmap-bfk -script-args hostmap-bfk.prefix=hostmap- www.<site>.com and press Enter.

>Perform an HTTP trace on the targeted domain.
>In the terminal window, type nmap --script http-trace -d www.<site>.com and press Enter.
>This script will detect a vulnerable server that uses the TRACE method by sending an HTTP TRACE request that
shows if the method is enabled or not.

>Now, check whether Web Application Firewall is configured on the target host or domain.
>In the terminal window, type nmap -p80 --script http-waf-detect www.<site>.com and press Enter.
>This command will scan the host and attempt to determine whether a web server is being monitored by an IPS, IDS, or WAF.
>This command will probe the target host with malicious payloads and detect the changes in the response code.

----------------------------------Uniscan Web Server Fingerprinting (Parrot)----------------------
Uniscan is a versatile server fingerprinting tool that not only performs simple commands like ping, traceroute,
and nslookup, but also does static, dynamic, and stress checks on a web server. Apart from scanning websites, 
uniscan also performs automated Bing and Google searches on provided IPs. Uniscan takes all of this data and combines
them into a comprehensive report file for the user.
